Almost all of my classes are in the adjacent classroom so I consider myself an expert on this one. I'm gonna be upfront, it's not the cleanest. Where this bathroom really shines is the convenience. If you need to go, you're not gonna miss too much of class and you can even refill your water bottle while you're gone!
