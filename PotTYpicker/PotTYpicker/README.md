# Application Description 
PotTYpicker is your go-to application for user rated reviews on the best and the worst bathrooms. Users would log in, go to a location they need to use a restroom in and see ratings for bathrooms in that area. Once users click into a building they move onto the bathroom, they are then allowed to read specifics on those ratings. Users are also able to leave a comment or a picture themselves in that bathroom. In the user review page, there is a way to go back to the map, have an overview of everything, a text box for your comment, and the bathroom room number. Extra functionality features include the user being able to hover their mouse over a building and an image of said building will appear, a rating system out of 5 made from stars, and a mail system to instantly message janitorial staff auto-generated messages depending on the picture clicked.
