I did not collaborate with anyone or receive help from anyone except Dr.Lama.
Dr.Lama helped me understand what the goal was, it forced me to redo my program because I was not doing it correctly.
Yes, everything i did is correct. 
The assignment took a lot of thinking, the hardest part about it was having to keep up with the different cases and figuring out how to implement LRU.
The only weird things that my assignment does is for part 1 it prints out a bunch of numbers but I am not sure why, it doesnt affect my output file though as the md5sum is correct.
Also for part2 it prints a bunch of new lines but it doesnt affect my output file and the md5sum is correct.
